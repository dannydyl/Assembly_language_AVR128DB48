# ESE280 Embedded Microcontroller Systems Design I - Lab Repository

## Overview

This repository documents the laboratory work for ESE280 Embedded Microcontroller Systems Design I at Stony Brook University, instructed by Prof. Kenneth Short. The course delves into the essentials of microcontroller-based embedded system design, with a practical emphasis on using the Atmel/Microchip AVR128DB48 microcontroller.

## Course Objectives

- Grasp fundamental hardware and software principles in embedded systems design.
- Apply hands-on skills with the AVR128DB48 microcontroller using the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano board.
- Develop embedded applications and understand system-level design through practical lab exercises.

## Laboratory Focus

The laboratory component is vital, reinforcing theoretical knowledge through practical application. Students engage in diverse tasks, from simple microcontroller programming to complex embedded system integrations, all while utilizing the AVR128DB48 microcontroller.

## Tools and Software

- **Atmel Studio 7**: The primary IDE used for developing, testing, and debugging assembly code for the AVR microcontrollers.
- **OrCAD**: Used for circuit design and simulation, providing a graphical interface for creating and testing electronic circuits, complementing the microcontroller projects.

## Getting Started

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Atmel Studio 7 and OrCAD installed and configured on your workstation.
- **Repository Navigation**: The `Labs` folder contains subdirectories for each lab, including instructions, source code, and OrCAD design files.

## Lab Sessions

Each lab is an opportunity to apply lecture concepts in tangible projects, culminating in a deep understanding of embedded systems design. The use of OrCAD for circuit design tasks adds an extra dimension, bridging the gap between software programming and hardware design.

## Repository Structure

- `Labs`: Individual lab directories with instructions, AVR assembly code, and OrCAD design files.
- `Reference`: Essential datasheets and documentation, including AVR128DB48 specifics and OrCAD user guides.
