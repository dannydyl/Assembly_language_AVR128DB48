# ESE280 Embedded Microcontroller Systems Design I - Lab Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the laboratory work for ESE280 Embedded Microcontroller Systems Design I, a course that focuses on the fundamental hardware and software concepts in designing microcontroller-based embedded systems. The course, taught at Stony Brook University under the instruction of Prof. Kenneth Short, leverages the Atmel/Microchip AVR128DB48 microcontroller, providing hands-on experience in embedded systems design.

## Course Objectives

- To understand the core principles of embedded microcontroller systems design.
- To gain practical experience with the AVR128DB48 microcontroller, utilizing the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano development board.
- To develop proficiency in assembly language programming and microcontroller interfacing for embedded applications.

## Laboratory Overview

The labs are integral to the course, reinforcing concepts from lectures and providing practical, hands-on experience with microcontroller programming and interfacing. Each lab is designed around the AVR128DB48 microcontroller, exploring various aspects of embedded system design from basic IO operations to more complex system integrations.

## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with basic digital logic and assembly language is beneficial.
- **Tools**: Atmel Studio 7 is used for development, providing an integrated environment for coding, assembling, and debugging AVR assembly programs.

## Lab Sessions

Lab sessions are held weekly, emphasizing the application of lecture concepts in real-world scenarios. Students are tasked with designing, implementing, and testing various components of an embedded system, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of microcontroller-based system design.

## Repository Structure

- `Labs`: Contains individual directories for each lab session, including the lab instructions, assembly code, and any additional resources or data sheets.
- `Reference`: Includes datasheets for the AVR128DB48 microcontroller, Atmel 8-bit instruction set, and other pertinent documentation for successful lab completion.

## Installation

1. **Atmel Studio 7**: Follow the [installation guide](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/atmel-studio-7) to set up Atmel Studio on your computer.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to download the lab materials and start experimenting with the code.
